For a very brief period of time I was trying to actively keep a dream diary. This was partly an attempt to improve my chances of lucid dreaming and partly  because I found it amusing to reflect on. 
I kept the diary in both physical form and as a [blog](https://cantwealldream.wordpress.com). Glancing back on that blog is quite an embarrassing exercise, yet I'm still quite keen to continue to explore my dreams. 

It's been almost 4 years since my last dream diary entry, I've still not succeeded in lucid dreaming and my dream recall has been pretty dire lately. So, a failure overall. However, my night's sleep is interrupted frequently enough (seemingly for no good reason) that disturbing it further to jot down a dream isn't going to cause any major disruption.

My hope is to keep a semi-regular log of my dreams on this site. The only rule I will impose on myself is that I must copy the logs verbatim from my physical journal (save for names, to avoid any potential embarrassment).
