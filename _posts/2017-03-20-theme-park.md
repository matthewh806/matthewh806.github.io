>Kenny and I were at some kind of rollercoaster museum, looking at the history of rides. It was all handled as if you were on a rollercoaster the whole time (a very slow one). At the end there was an actual rollercoaster, with "Wilson loops". My safety bar can't open midjourny and i was stuck hanging in for dear life

>An old man frantically grabbed me and said "Charles Mingus" 

I found this entry in my phone on the morning of the 19/03/2017 with absolutely no recollection of noting it down. 
The creation time on the note was: 04:59 and the last edit time: 05:09.

My favourite part of the entry is the [Wilson loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_loop), I've been reading up on Quantum Field Theory recently and so it makes some sense that it was on my mind. 
The other namedrop is [Charles Mingus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus) and I genuinely have no idea where that came from. I'm also guessing this line was added during the 05:09 edit. Was it a separate dream?

The most problematic line is:
>My safety bar can't open midjourny and i was stuck hanging in for dear life

This is clearly the climax of the dream, the point moments before waking and I wrote down the events incorrectly. I quite obviously meant to say the bar did open midjourney and yet managed to describe the opposite.
