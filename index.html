	<h1>Matthew Harris</h1>
	<p><img src="{{ "/assets/images/hat.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height=auto width="200"></p>
	<p>I'm a software developer and (ex-)scientist based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 
	My main interests are physics, programming and movies.</p>
	
	<h2>Current</h2>
	<p> I'm currently employed as a <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> game developer at <a href="https://www.squla.nl">Squla</a> making educational
	apps for children. </p>

	<p> I'm still very interested in physics and in my spare time try to push myself beyond what I studied as part of my formal education. 	
	</p>

	<p>
	My other great interest is in movies. I try my best to see as many (and as wide a range of) movies as possible. Recently i've been tracking and reviewing each movie I watch, you can find my film list on <a href="https://Letterboxd.com/matthewh806">Letterboxd</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p> My academic background is in theoretical physics mainly focused on particle physics and cosmology. For my masters project I considered extensions to the standard model by the introduction of additional Higgs bosons.</p>
