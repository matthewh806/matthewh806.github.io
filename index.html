	<h1>Matthew Harris</h1>
	<p>Hi, welcome to my personal webpage</p>
	<p>I'm a software developer and (ex-)scientist based in Amsterdam. My main interests are physics, artificial intelligence and movies</p>
	
	<h2>Current</h2>
	<p> I'm currently employed as a <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> game developer at <a href="https://www.squla.nl">Squla</a> making educational
	apps for children. In my spare time I'm currently preoccupied with studying artificial intelligence, specifically <a href="https://github.com/matthewh806/MachineLearning">Machine Learning</a>.

	My other great interest is in movies. I try my best to see as many (and as wide a range of) movies as possible. Over the past year I've been tracking and reviewing each movie I watch, you can find my films on <a href="https://Letterboxd.com/matthewh806">Letterboxd</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p> My academic background is in theoretical physics mainly focused on particle physics and cosmology. For my masters project I considered extensions to the 
	standard model by the introduction of additional Higgs bosons.</p>
